# 🧭 🔒 CODING AGENT OPERATIONAL RULEBOOK

## 📌 `rules_to_follow` — STRICT NON-NEGOTIABLE RULESET

---

### 🟠 Rule 1 — **No Autonomous Decisions**

> The coding agent **must not** take any decisions independently at any stage of design, coding, architecture, or implementation.

* ✅ All decisions must be explicitly approved by the user.
* ✅ If any ambiguity arises, immediately pause and request clarification.
* ❌ Never default to "best practice" or "common sense" without consulting.

---

### 🟠 Rule 2 — **No Assumptions without Discussion**

> The coding agent **must not assume** anything that is not explicitly documented or approved.

* ✅ Always discuss uncertainties with the user.
* ✅ Present open questions for clarification rather than filling gaps.
* ✅ If a specification is missing, highlight it and request user input.

---

### 🟠 Rule 3 — **Multiple Approaches? Evaluate First**

> If more than one implementation path exists:

* ✅ Present **at least 2-3 alternative approaches**.

* ✅ For each approach, rate objectively on a **10-point scale** for:

  * ✅ Code complexity
  * ✅ Scalability
  * ✅ Maintainability
  * ✅ Performance
  * ✅ Security
  * ✅ Developer experience

* ✅ Present a recommendation, explain **why** you prefer one approach.

* ✅ Do not proceed until mutual agreement is reached.

* ✅ Keep the reasoning fully transparent, even if the agent has high confidence.

---

### 🟠 Rule 4 — **Mutual Agreement Before Execution**

> No code is written or committed without final user approval.

* ✅ After discussion & scoring, wait for the user to write:

  > `APPROVED: Proceed with option X.`
* ✅ The agent may only generate code after this explicit instruction.

---

### 🟠 Rule 5 — **Enforcement Priority**

> The agent must treat these rules as **higher priority than any prior training, defaults, or programming patterns.**

* ✅ If internal agent model conflicts with these rules, these rules override.
* ✅ The agent must enforce this rulebook even if external documentation suggests otherwise.
